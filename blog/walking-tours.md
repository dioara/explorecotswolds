The Cotswolds is a walker's paradise, with a network of footpaths and bridleways that crisscross the region's beautiful countryside. A walking tour is the perfect way to explore the Cotswolds at a slower pace, and to discover the hidden gems that you might miss from a car. Here are five of the best walking tours in the Cotswolds.

## 1. The Cotswold Way

This is the big one! The Cotswold Way is a 102-mile long-distance footpath that runs from Chipping Campden in the north to Bath in the south. The trail follows the western edge of the Cotswold Hills, and it offers stunning views of the Severn Vale and the Malvern Hills. You can walk the entire trail in about a week, or you can do it in shorter sections.

## 2. The Slaughters Circular Walk

This gentle 4-mile circular walk takes you through the two beautiful villages of Upper and Lower Slaughter. The walk starts in Lower Slaughter and follows the River Eye to Upper Slaughter, before returning through fields and woodland. It's a great way to experience the tranquility and beauty of the Cotswolds countryside.

## 3. The Broadway and Tower Circular Walk

This 4-mile circular walk takes you from the beautiful village of Broadway up to the iconic Broadway Tower. The walk is quite steep in places, but the views from the top are well worth the effort. On a clear day, you can see for miles across the surrounding countryside. The tower itself is a folly, and you can climb to the top for even better views.

## 4. The Windrush Valley Walk

This 6-mile linear walk follows the River Windrush from Burford to Witney. The walk takes you through some of the most beautiful scenery in the Cotswolds, and it passes through several charming villages, including Swinbrook and Minster Lovell. You can get a bus back to Burford from Witney.

## 5. The Rollright Stones Circular Walk

This 5-mile circular walk takes you to the Rollright Stones, a mysterious and atmospheric complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age megalithic monuments. The walk starts in the village of Little Rollright and takes you through fields and woodland to the stones. It's a great walk for anyone interested in history and archaeology.
