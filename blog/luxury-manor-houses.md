## 1. The Slaughters Manor House, Lower Slaughter

This 17th-century manor house is the epitome of country house chic. The interiors are a stylish mix of contemporary design and traditional features, and the hotel has a relaxed and informal atmosphere. The hotel's restaurant has been awarded a Michelin star, and the extensive gardens are the perfect place to relax and unwind.

## 2. Lords of the Manor, Upper Slaughter

Located in the equally beautiful village of Upper Slaughter, Lords of the Manor is a former rectory that has been converted into a luxury hotel. The hotel has a more traditional and classic feel than its sister hotel in Lower Slaughter, with antique furniture and open fires. The hotel also has a Michelin-starred restaurant, and the 8 acres of gardens are a joy to explore.

## 3. Ellenborough Park, Cheltenham

This magnificent 15th-century manor house is located on the outskirts of Cheltenham, making it the perfect base for exploring both the Cotswolds and the town's famous racecourse.

The hotel is surrounded by 10 acres of gardens, which include a croquet lawn and a tennis court.

## 5. Foxhill Manor, Broadway

This Grade II listed Arts and Crafts manor house is a private house hotel, which means you can treat it as your own.

It's the ultimate in personalized luxury.
