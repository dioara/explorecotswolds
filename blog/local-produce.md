The Cotswolds is a region with a rich agricultural heritage, and this is reflected in the abundance of delicious local produce on offer. From rare breed meats to artisan cheeses, there are plenty of culinary delights to discover. Here are five local products that you have to try on your next visit to the Cotswolds.

## 1. Single Gloucester Cheese

This is a mild, semi-hard cheese that has been made in Gloucestershire since the 16th century. It is a PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) product, which means it can only be made in Gloucestershire to a specific recipe. It has a smooth texture and a delicate, nutty flavor, and it is often enjoyed with a slice of apple or a dollop of chutney.

## 2. Gloucester Old Spot Pork

The Gloucester Old Spot is a rare breed of pig that is famous for its high-quality meat. The pigs are known for their distinctive black spots, and they are allowed to roam freely in orchards and pastures, which gives the meat a rich and succulent flavor. You can find Gloucester Old Spot pork on the menu at many of the region's best pubs and restaurants.

## 3. Tewkesbury Mustard

This is a fiery and pungent mustard that has been made in the town of Tewkesbury since the 16th century. It is made with a blend of mustard flour and horseradish, which gives it a powerful kick. It was even mentioned in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 2. It is the perfect accompaniment to a Gloucester Old Spot sausage.

## 4. Bibury Trout

The crystal-clear waters of the River Coln are home to a thriving population of brown trout, and the Bibury Trout Farm is one of the oldest in the country. You can buy fresh or smoked trout from the farm shop, or you can try it on the menu at many of the local pubs and restaurants. It has a delicate and delicious flavor, and it is best enjoyed simply with a squeeze of lemon.

## 5. Stinking Bishop Cheese

Don't be put off by the name! This is a soft, washed-rind cheese that has a powerful aroma but a surprisingly delicate flavor. It is made from the milk of Gloucester cattle, and it is washed in perry (a type of pear cider) made from the Stinking Bishop pear, which gives the cheese its distinctive smell. It is a truly unique and delicious cheese that is a must-try for any cheese lover.

### Where to Find Local Produce

The best way to sample the local produce of the Cotswolds is to visit one of the many farmers' markets that are held in the region's towns and villages. Stroud Farmers' Market is one of the biggest and best, but you can also find excellent markets in Cirencester, Cheltenham, and Moreton-in-Marsh.
