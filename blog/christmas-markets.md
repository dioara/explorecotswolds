The Cotswolds is a magical place to be at Christmas, with its honey-colored stone villages, cozy pubs with roaring fires, and a festive atmosphere that is hard to beat. One of the highlights of the Christmas season in the Cotswolds is the many Christmas markets that take place in the region’s towns and villages. Here are five of the most magical Christmas markets in the Cotswolds.

## 1. Bath Christmas Market

Although not strictly in the Cotswolds, the Bath Christmas Market is so good that it’s worth a special mention. This award-winning market is one of the biggest and best in the country, with over 150 chalets selling a wide range of gifts, food, and drink. The market is set in the beautiful city of Bath, and the backdrop of the Abbey and the Roman Baths makes it a truly magical experience.

## 3. Blenheim Palace Christmas Market

The Blenheim Palace Christmas Market is a truly spectacular event. The market is set in the magnificent grounds of the palace, and it features a wide range of stalls selling high-quality gifts and delicious food and drink.
