The Cotswolds' famous villages are popular for a reason, but sometimes the most memorable travel experiences are found off the beaten path. If you're looking to escape the crowds and discover a more authentic side of the Cotswolds, here are five hidden gems that are well worth exploring.

## 1. Snowshill

Nestled in the hills above Broadway, **Snowshill** is a tranquil village with a timeless feel. Its main attraction is **Snowshill Manor and Garden**, a National Trust property filled with the eclectic collections of its former owner, Charles Wade. The manor is a treasure trove of curiosities, and the terraced gardens offer stunning views of the surrounding countryside.

## 2. Blockley

Once a center for the silk industry, **Blockley** is a charming village with a unique character. Its stream, which once powered the silk mills, still flows through the village, and many of the old mill buildings have been converted into beautiful homes. The village has a peaceful atmosphere and is a great base for exploring the northern Cotswolds.

## 3. Stanton

Often described as one of the most unspoiled villages in the Cotswolds, **Stanton** is a picture-perfect village with a single main street lined with honey-colored stone cottages. The village has a traditional pub, The Mount Inn, which offers panoramic views from its beer garden. Stanton is a great starting point for walks along the Cotswold Way.

## 4. Painswick

Known as the "Queen of the Cotswolds," **Painswick** is a historic wool town with a maze of narrow streets and beautiful stone buildings. The town is famous for the 99 yew trees in the churchyard of St. Mary's Church, and the Rococo Garden, a unique 18th-century garden that is the only one of its kind in the country.

## 5. Minster Lovell

Located on the River Windrush, **Minster Lovell** is a charming village with a dark past. It is home to the ruins of **Minster Lovell Hall**, a 15th-century manor house that was once the home of the Lovell family. The hall is said to be haunted, and the story of its last resident, Francis Lovell, is a tale of mystery and intrigue.
