The Cotswolds is a region steeped in tradition, and this is reflected in its many quirky and unusual events. From chasing a wheel of cheese down a hill to kicking your opponents in the shins, there are plenty of bizarre and brilliant events to experience. Here are five of the quirkiest events in the Cotswolds.

## 1. Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake

This world-famous event sees competitors chase a 9lb wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a near-vertical hill. The first person to cross the finish line at the bottom of the hill wins the cheese. It’s a dangerous and chaotic event, but it’s also a lot of fun to watch. The event takes place every year on the Spring Bank Holiday Monday.

## 2. The Cotswold Olimpicks

This is a modern-day revival of a 17th-century sporting event. The games include a variety of unusual events, such as shin-kicking, tug-of-war, and wheelbarrow racing. The games are held every year on the Friday after the Spring Bank Holiday, and they are a great day out for the whole family.

## 3. Tetbury Woolsack Races

This event sees competitors carry a 60lb woolsack up and down a steep hill in the town of Tetbury. The race is a test of strength and endurance, and it’s a great spectacle to watch. The event takes place every year on the last bank holiday in May, and it raises money for local charities.

## 4. Bourton-on-the-Water Football in the River

This is exactly what it sounds like! Every August bank holiday Monday, two teams from the local football club play a game of football in the River Windrush. It’s a chaotic and hilarious event, and it always draws a large crowd. The game is followed by a fete on the village green.

## 5. Bibury Duck Race

This is a more gentle but equally fun event. Every Boxing Day, thousands of plastic ducks are released into the River Coln in Bibury. The first duck to cross the finish line wins a prize for its owner. It’s a great way to walk off your Christmas dinner, and it raises money for local charities.
