Afternoon tea is a quintessential English tradition, and there's no better place to indulge in this delightful ritual than the Cotswolds. From grand manor houses to cozy tearooms, the region offers a wide range of afternoon tea experiences. Here are five of the best places to enjoy afternoon tea in the Cotswolds.

## 1. The Lygon Arms, Broadway

You can enjoy a selection of sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and jam, and a variety of cakes and pastries, all served on a tiered stand. In the winter, you can enjoy your tea by a roaring fire, and in the summer, you can take it in the beautiful courtyard.

## 2. Lords of the Manor, Upper Slaughter
