The Cotswolds is a gardener’s paradise, with a huge variety of beautiful gardens to explore. From grand formal gardens to intimate cottage gardens, there’s something for everyone. A garden tour is a great way to discover the region’s horticultural highlights, and to get some inspiration for your own garden. Here are five of the best garden tours in the Cotswolds.

## 1. Hidcote Manor Garden

This world-famous garden is one of the most influential gardens of the 20th century. It was created by the American horticulturist, Major Lawrence Johnston, and it is a masterpiece of garden design. The garden is divided into a series of “rooms,” each with its own character and planting style. It’s a garden that is full of surprises, and it’s a must-visit for any garden lover.

## 2. Kiftsgate Court Gardens

Located just a stone’s throw from Hidcote, Kiftsgate is another stunning garden that is famous for its romantic and abundant planting style. The garden is home to the Kiftsgate rose, which is the largest rose in England. The garden is divided into a series of different areas, including a white garden, a rose garden, and a bluebell wood.

## 3. Sudeley Castle and Gardens

This historic castle is surrounded by ten magnificent gardens, each with its own unique character. The Queen’s Garden is a beautiful Tudor-style garden with a stunning collection of old-fashioned roses, and the Knot Garden is a beautiful and intricate formal garden. The castle and gardens are a great day out for the whole family.

## 4. Painswick Rococo Garden

This unique 18th-century garden is the only one of its kind in the country. It was designed in the 1740s as a pleasure garden for the owner of Painswick House, and it is a flamboyant and theatrical garden with a series of follies and other architectural features. The garden is a great place to let your imagination run wild.

## 5. Batsford Arboretum

This 56-acre arboretum is home to a stunning collection of trees and shrubs from around the world. The arboretum is particularly beautiful in the autumn, when the leaves turn a spectacular array of colors. The arboretum also has a beautiful Japanese garden, a visitor center, and a cafe.
