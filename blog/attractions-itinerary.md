The Cotswolds, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in southern England, is a storybook landscape of rolling hills, honey-colored stone villages, and meandering rivers. This 3-day itinerary is designed to help you discover the very best of this quintessentially English region, from its most famous attractions to its hidden gems.

## Day 1: The Eastern Cotswolds - Grand Palaces & Famous Villages

### Morning: Blenheim Palace

Start your Cotswolds adventure at **Blenheim Palace**, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill. This monumental country house is a masterpiece of 18th-century Baroque architecture, set in over 2,000 acres of parkland landscaped by the legendary Capability Brown. Allow at least 3-4 hours to explore the opulent State Rooms, the Churchill Exhibition, and the magnificent formal gardens.

### Afternoon: Burford & Bibury

From Blenheim, take a scenic drive to **Burford**, often called the "Gateway to the Cotswolds." Its high street, lined with antique shops and traditional pubs, sweeps down to the River Windrush. After lunch, continue to **Bibury**, famously described by William Morris as "the most beautiful village in England." The iconic **Arlington Row**, a line of 17th-century weavers' cottages, is one of the most photographed scenes in the Cotswolds.

## Day 2: The Heart of the Cotswolds - Market Towns & Riverside Charm

### Morning: Bourton-on-the-Water & The Slaughters

Known as the "Venice of the Cotswolds," **Bourton-on-the-Water** is famous for the River Windrush that flows through its center, crossed by several low stone bridges. It can get busy, so an early start is recommended. From here, it's a short drive or a pleasant walk to the tranquil villages of **Lower Slaughter** and **Upper Slaughter**, which offer a more peaceful glimpse into traditional Cotswold life.

### Afternoon: Stow-on-the-Wold & Broadway

Perched on a hilltop, **Stow-on-the-Wold** is a historic market town with a large market square and a fascinating history. Don't miss St. Edward's Church, with its famous yew-tree-framed door. In the afternoon, head to **Broadway**, known for its wide main street lined with independent shops, art galleries, and restaurants. For stunning views, drive up to **Broadway Tower**, the Cotswolds' highest castle.

## Day 3: The Western Cotswolds - Castles, Gardens & Film Locations

### Morning: Sudeley Castle & Gardens

**Sudeley Castle**, located near the town of Winchcombe, has a rich and royal history. It was once home to Queen Katherine Parr, the last of Henry VIII's wives. The castle is surrounded by ten magnificent gardens, each with its own unique character. The castle and gardens provide a fascinating insight into England's past.

### Afternoon: Castle Combe

Conclude your Cotswolds tour in **Castle Combe**, a village so picturesque it has been a filming location for movies like *War Horse* and *Stardust*. With no new houses built since the 1600s, it feels like stepping back in time. Enjoy a traditional cream tea at one of the village's charming tea rooms before heading home.
