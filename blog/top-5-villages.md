The Cotswolds are famous for their picturesque villages, where honey-colored stone cottages, charming pubs, and ancient churches create a timeless English countryside scene. With so many beautiful villages to choose from, it can be hard to know where to start. Here are five of the most beautiful villages in the Cotswolds that you simply must visit.

## 1. Castle Combe

Often called "the prettiest village in England," **Castle Combe** is a breathtakingly beautiful village that has remained largely unchanged for centuries. Its main street is lined with ancient weavers' cottages, and the village has been a popular filming location for productions like *War Horse* and *Stardust*. The absence of modern buildings and overhead wires makes it feel like you've stepped back in time.

## 2. Bibury

**Bibury** is another contender for the title of England's most beautiful village. Its most famous landmark is **Arlington Row**, a stunning line of 17th-century weavers' cottages that is one of the most photographed scenes in the Cotswolds. The River Coln, which flows through the village, is home to a thriving population of trout, and the Bibury Trout Farm is a popular attraction.

## 3. Bourton-on-the-Water

Known as the "Venice of the Cotswolds," **Bourton-on-the-Water** is famous for the River Windrush that flows through its center, crossed by several low stone bridges. The village has a wide range of attractions, including the Model Village, the Cotswold Motoring Museum, and Birdland Park and Gardens. It's a bustling village with a lively atmosphere, perfect for a family day out.

## 4. Broadway

With its wide, tree-lined high street, **Broadway** is one of the most elegant and impressive villages in the Cotswolds. The street is lined with independent shops, art galleries, and restaurants, all housed in beautiful honey-colored stone buildings. For panoramic views of the surrounding countryside, take a trip up to **Broadway Tower**, the Cotswolds' highest castle.

## 5. Stow-on-the-Wold

Perched on a hilltop, **Stow-on-the-Wold** is a historic market town with a large and impressive market square. The town has a rich history, and it was the site of the last battle of the English Civil War. Today, it's a bustling town with a great selection of antique shops, pubs, and restaurants. Don't miss the ancient yew trees framing the door of St. Edward's Church.
